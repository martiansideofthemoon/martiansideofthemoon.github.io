Previously, I wrote an [article]({% post_url 2017-12-08-gre-toefl-preparation %}) on GRE and TOEFL preparation. This is my second blogpost on graduate school admissions. I have tried to compile all the online resources I used to prepare my graduate school application.  
Most of this advice is **written by professors** and is focused towards PhD applicants. Several webpages shared in this blog contain a wide-spectrum of advice articles, many of which are relevant to undergraduates and graduate school applicants.

**Students' Perspective on Grad School Applications** - Most recently, we have surveyed twelve recent NLP PhD applicants on their experience while applying to graduate school. Unlike the remainder of this article, this article was written by young PhD students who applied to graduate school in the last 3 years. Check it out [here](https://blog.nelsonliu.me/2019/10/24/student-perspectives-on-applying-to-nlp-phd-programs/)!

### PhD Application Guides

* [Mor Harchol Balter's Guide](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) - An excellent but slightly out-dated guide on writing good PhD applications by a CMU professor. This is a very comprehensive article which starts with the pros and cons of a PhD degree, moves to the application process and ends with some advice on choosing the correct graduate program.

* [Philip Guo's Five-Minute Guide](http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-application-tips.htm) - A short guide describing the initial screening process during PhD admissions. Lots of interesting videos / articles in the "related pages" section at the end of the guide. You might find the Statements of Purpose linked in this article useful. Philip Guo also has a Vlog on [finding computer science PhD programs](http://www.pgbovine.net/PG-Vlog-203-applying-to-CS-PhD-programs.htm) to apply to using [CSRankings](csrankings.org/).

* [Philip Guo's Older Guide](http://www.pgbovine.net/grad-school-app-tips.htm) - A more comprehensive article listing the best strategies to maximize your chances of selection. This was written while Philip Guo was still a graduate student.

* [Jean Yang's Guide](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2008/08/cs-grad-school-part-1-deciding-to-apply.html) - A seven-part comprehensive article on the whole PhD admission process. Jean Yang's Statement of Purpose is very well-written, and helped me considerably. This guide also contains details about what to look for during visit days.

* [Jason Eisner's Guide](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/prospective-students.html) for JHU / CLSP - A very nice article on graduate admission process, with a focus on JHU admissions into the [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](http://clsp.jhu.edu/) (a top research group for prospective NLP / Speech students). This article contains an important section on school rankings (and why they should be taken with a grain of salt). Prof. Jason Eisner has written several excellent advice articles [here](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/), some of which are relevant to graduate school admissions. He is also quite active on Quora.

  CLSP has also written a broader PhD admission FAQ [here](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/apply-for-phd/phd-admissions-faq/).

* [CMU LTI Admission Guide](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-admissions-committee-process-for-graduate-school-look-like-Do-you-sit-in-a-room-and-all-discuss-the-same-candidate-at-the-same-time-or-is-it-more-of-an-individual-process-with-opinions-aggregated-at-the-end) - This Quora answer by Scott Fahlman is very specific to to MLT / PhD admissions at LTI (Language Technologies Institute) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). There is another answer by Alex Rudnicky [here](https://www.quora.com/How-competitive-is-admission-to-the-masters-program-at-Carnegie-Mellons-Language-Technologies-Institute-for-applicants-who-dont-have-an-undergraduate-degree-in-computer-science-but-do-have-an-undergraduate-degree-in-linguistics-with-some-computer-science-coursework). Scott Fahlman has written several interesting Quora answers on NLP and academica-related topics [here](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-E-Fahlman/answers?sort=views).

  Finally, [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ddanish/blog/mlt-to-phd/) is an article by Danish Pruthi discussing the conversion statistics from an MLT degree to a PhD degree, an important question many NLP PhD candidates have.
