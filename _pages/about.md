I am currently a Senior Research Scientist in Google DeepMind, where I am working in the [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) team. Our team works on improving instruction following and general model quality of the Gemini models in the post-training phase.

I finished my PhD in August 2023 at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu/) in the College for Information and Computer Science. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) and worked on exciting problems in long-form text generation. I used to co-organize the [Machine Learning and Friends Lunch](https://umass-mlfl.github.io/) at UMass Amherst (Fall 2019 - Spring 2022). I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification.

I've spent some excellent summers in industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2022, I interned at Semantic Scholar in [AI2](https://allenai.org/), working with Kyle Lo, Arman Cohan and Pradeep Dasigi on human evaluation of long-form summarization. In Summer 2021, I interned at the Google Research India team with Partha Talukdar and Bidisha Samanta working on low-resource multilingual style transfer. In Summer 2020, I interned at the [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain) team with [Aurko Roy](https://sites.google.com/site/royaurko) working on retrieval augmented generation algorithms. In Summer 2019 I worked on model extraction attacks with the [Google AI Language](https://ai.google/research/teams/language/) team in New York under the mentorship of [Gaurav Singh Tomar](https://ai.google/research/people/GauravSinghTomar/) and [Ankur Parikh](https://ai.google/research/people/104995/) and [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/).
In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution).

When I'm not working, I am generally [birding]({ site.url }}/birding), hiking, biking reading or star gazing. I like to [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive.html) and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, visa applications, biking etc. During my undergraduate days, I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. I also used to actively contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. Finally, I [collect]({{ site.url }}/assets/rubik.jpg) Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I am not good at solving them!

Some people on the internet (especially on Mozilla's IRC) know me as *martianwars*.
